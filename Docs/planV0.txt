# 🧹 Universal Open-Source Disk Wiper

A bootable **open-source disk wiping tool** that works on **any device and filesystem** (HDD, SSD, NVMe).  
Inspired by DBAN, but modern and flexible.  

⚠️ **Warning:** This tool **permanently destroys all data**. Use with extreme caution!

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Goal
- Bootable USB-based tool to securely wipe disks.  
- Supports HDDs, SSDs, NVMe drives.  
- Works regardless of filesystem (operates on block devices).  
- Open-source and easy to extend.  

---

## 📌 SDLC Phases

### 1. Requirements
- Must boot without OS installed.  
- Must provide **autonuke mode** (auto-wipes all disks).  
- Must provide **interactive menu** for manual disk selection.  
- Must support standard wipe methods (DoD, Gutmann, Zero-fill).  

### 2. Design
- Base OS: Minimal Linux (Debian Live or Alpine Linux).  
- Bootloader: GRUB or Syslinux.  
- Components:
  - Disk Detection (lsblk, fdisk).  
  - Wipe Engine (shred, dd, hdparm, nvme-cli).  
  - TUI (dialog/whiptail).  
  - Logging (optional).  

### 3. Implementation
- Scripts for:
  - Disk detection.  
  - Autonuke mode.  
  - Interactive mode.  
- ISO build with `debian-live` or `mkisofs`.  

### 4. Testing
- Unit test: run wipe on dummy files.  
- Integration test: full flow (boot → detect → wipe).  
- Validation: ensure data recovery fails.  

### 5. Deployment
- Publish ISO.  
- Provide USB flashing instructions.  

### 6. Maintenance
- Keep dependencies up to date.  
- Add new wipe methods.  
- Improve hardware support.
